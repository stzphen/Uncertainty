Description

For my term project, I will be making a board game called "Uncertainty". This is a variation of risk that is based off an online version of Risk called Warzone. This game will feature a player playing against two AIs, and the ultimate objective is to strategically attack opponents and move your troops to take over the world and all the other territories.

Running the Project

To run the project, make sure all the pictures and files are together in the same folder. The file that needs to be run is "riskStart.py". PIL needs to be installed to open the images.

Shortcuts

To skip to the end of the game, the key "f" is for forfeiting and "w" is to see a win. The key "h" allows you to see all the territories to see the moves going on in the background. The key "l" is a special surprise.
